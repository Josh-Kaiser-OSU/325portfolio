## A key for what each figure means:
' &nbsp;' - a space that is not yet lit up by a flashlight.

\# - Will block light from passing but do not have a number constraint.

1234 - represents how many flahslights need to be placed around the block containing the number. These will also block light.

¥ - represents a flashlight (which you will need to place).

≈ - represents that the square on the board is lit up by a flashlight.

|≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ¥ ≈ ≈ |4
|# ¥ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ |3
|¥ 4 ¥ ≈ ≈ 0 ≈ |2
|≈ ¥ ≈ ≈ # ≈ ¥ |1
